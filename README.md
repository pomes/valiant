## Attribution

I have used the [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) library to package
this project and guide my implementation efforts.

The [Hypermodern Python series](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/) by
Claudio Jolowicz is a great resource and you'll see his guidance instilled in this codebase.
